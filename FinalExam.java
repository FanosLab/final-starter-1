saw a squirrel busy collecting nuts. Analyzing the scene with his detective eyes, there was a tree,
the squirrel, and 3 nuts. As was his habit in helping others, Sherlock decided to help the squirrel
by finding out the the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under
the tree one by one. 

To do so, Sherlock opened his 2SH4 notes and he found that he can simulate
the scene as a 2D grid and use the Point class covered in lectures (in file Point.java) to determine the
position of all the nuts, the tree, and the squirrel.


Then, he wants to write a function that takes as input his information and return the minimum
distance. 
However after writing the following prototype:

double minDistance(,,)

 he got stuck.

You are required to help him to correctly write the THREE input parameters to this method and implement it to return the minimum distance by the squirrel
to collect all nuts and put them at the tree. Sherlock told you that given positions are not
overlapping (i.e. no two nuts are in same position). The squirrel can take at most one nut at one
time. The given positions of nuts have no order and all positions are positive integers. The given
positions contain at least one nut, and there is only one tree and one squirrel.
